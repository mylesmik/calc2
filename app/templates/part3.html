                        <b>Encapsulation</b> is the concept that an object contains its own, private information. Within a
                        class that is built around an object, the class contains public methods that are able to operate
                        on the private information held within the objects private variables. The private information
                        for an object is unique to that object, and even objects within the same class cannot directly
                        access that information.

                        Encapsulation can be better understood by the example of various departments within an
                        organization.
                        Since there are various departments in an organization that work together to complete
                        tasks/projects, etc. There are times
                        when a department may want to access information from another department and in order to do so
                        it would need to ask permission to
                        access the information from the other department as that information is private to only that
                        department, and it cannot be accessed
                        directly or manipulated in any sort of way.

                        In this code snippet we see the Class <b>Calculation</b> having the methods <b>__init__(),

                        From the above code snippets we notice that all the above classes <b>Inherit</b> the properties
                        of the <b>Calculation class</b> , in this program the Calcualtion class is essential to be
                        inherited from as this class does the task of creating the objects of the various types of
                        operations to be performed in our Calculator.

                    <p class="card-text">
                        Thus, we see the use of <b>Inheritance</b> where the classes <b>Addition, Subtraction,
                        Multiplication and Division</b> all inherit the properties of Calculation and since it is
                        transitive in nature so all the subclasses of Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication and Division
                        also inherit from Calculation.

                        to implement more complex logic on top of the provided abstraction without understanding or even
                        thinking about all the hidden complexity.

                        operations which eventually leads to the Addition operation. This is exactly what
